Given a list of positive numbers without duplicates and a target number, find all unique combinations of the numbers that sum to the target. Note: You may use the same number more than once.

Ex: Given the following numbers and targetâ€¦

numbers = [2,4,6,3], target = 6,
return [
    [2,2,2],
    [2,4],
    [3,3],
    [6]
]

  numbers.sort()

    for n in numbers:
      if not paths or n >= paths[-1]:
        if sum + n == target:
            ans.append(paths + [n])
        elif sum + n < target:
            uniqSumshelper(sum + n, paths + [n])
