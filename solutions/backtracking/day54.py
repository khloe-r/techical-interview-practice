Given a list of positive numbers without duplicates and a target number, find all unique combinations of the numbers that sum to the target. Note: You may use the same number more than once.

Ex: Given the following numbers and targetâ€¦

numbers = [2,4,6,3], target = 6,
return [
    [2,2,2],
    [2,4],
    [3,3],
    [6]
]
